				My Name is Bradley Schmaeman. I have an associates degree in graphic design. I have been in the field for over 15 years. I am looking to advance my carreer with this web coding course. So far so difficalt.<br>
				On a personal note, I enjoy hiking threw our wonderful metroparks, and watching sports like football and hockey. I am a big supporter of animal adoption and have volunteered with a local cat foundation that fosters cats and kittens. They also take in abused and strays. I have abotpled all of my cats with them. Animals are a very big part of my life and I love their companionship and will always have them in my life.
